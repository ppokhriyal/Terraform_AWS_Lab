Create Public-Private ssh keys
==============================

I am using Ubuntu for creating the SSH keys

Command => $ sudo ssh-keygen -f mykey

Once you press enter it will ask for PassPhrase,so just ignore it and press enter and proceed.
Once the above command is executed successfully,two keys will be generated

-> Private key [ mykey ]
-> Public key  [ mykey.pub ]

Private key will be used for taking the SSH of the Ubuntu EC2 instance.
Public key will appear in "Key-Pair" section of AWS EC2.
